    <p><b>Here's a glimpse into my world.</b> If you don't already know by now my name is Josephine,
      but people like to call me Jo. I was originally from Los Angeles,
      but moved to the Bay Area when I was little. I enjoy hiking, going to the beach,
      and having BBQ's. I'd like to think I'm spontaneous, but not a dare devil. The craziest thing
      I've done would probably be ziplinning in the Santa Cruz Mountains and parasailing in Thailand.
      Currently I'm attending CSU East Bay majoring in Art with emphasis in Multimedia. I'm also
      an assistant manager at a photography studio. Besides from taking photos inside the studio, I also
      photograph on the side. I enjoy photographing people from maternity, newborn, and engagement.
      From time to time I love to photograph landscape and food as well.
      This is my website I've created to showcase my photography. Enjoy!

  <div class="text">
    <p>My friend and I went to The Table, located in Willow Glen, CA for some drinks and appetizers.
      It was our frist time there and I really enjoyed it. My <b>wagyu steak sandwich with a side of
      arugula salad</b> was to die for.
    Seriously it was delicious!!! Jam-packed with flavors and the steak was really juicy.</p>

  <div class="text">
    <p><b>Chicken liver mousse and pickles.</b> There was actually two pieces on the plate,
      but my friend ate one before I could photograph it. I love the white plate against the wodden
      table as the backdrop for the food.  </p>

  <div class="text">
  <p><b>Drake's Dealership</b> is such a classic place with it's authentic brick building look. They got their
    name becase this place used to be an old parts and service department for an old Dodge Dealership.
    The atmosphere is pretty great for an all outdoor experience and their pet freidnly too.</p>

    <p><b>Music and graffiti</b> go hand in hand and people associate graffiti with rap and hip hop.
    This is a photograph of my good friend Mike. He doesn't really listen to either of this music though.
    His passion is creating and mixing EDM tracks.</p>
